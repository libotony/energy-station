# Energy Station

Bancor protocol powered VET/Energy(VeThor) exchange contract.

## Concept

The Bancor Protocol enables automatic price determination and an autonomous liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains. In this caseï¼Œwe took advantage of the automatic price adjust mechanism from bancor protocol.We use the concept of [Relay Token](https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360000471472-How-do-Relay-Tokens-work-) but simplified the process of buying and selling. So the concepts of `Energy Station` are:

+ Create an bancor convert contract that connecting two tokens
+ One connector token is VET, the other one is VeThor token
+ The weight of connector token is 50%
+ No smart token concept just allow the convention between VET and VeThor token

### Buying VTHO by costing VET

```

+----+          +--------------+
|    | ---VET-->|              |
|User|          |Energy-Station|
|    | <--VTHO--|              |
+----+          +--------------+

### Buying VET by costing VTHO

```

+----+          +--------------+
|    | --VTHO-->|              |
|User|          |Energy-Station|
|    | <--VET---|              |
+----+          +--------------+

```

## Deployment

1. Deploy `EnergyStation`
2. `EnergyStation.setConversionFee(conversionFee in ppm)`
3. Send VET by `EnergyStation.fillVET()`
4. Approve EnergyStation for VTHO token
5. Send VTHO by `EnergyStation.fillEnergy()`
6. Enable conversion by `EnergyStation.disableConversions(false)`

The amount of VET and VTHO sent to `EnergyStation` will be the initial supply of two connector token.

## Usage

1. Simulate `EnergyStation.getEnergyReturn(amount)` or `EnergyStation.getVETReturn(amount)` to get converted value and calc minimum return as `minReturn`
2. Convert VET to VTHO: `EnergyStation.convertForVET(minReturn)` 
2. Convert VTHO to VET: `Energy.approve(EnergyStation, amount)` and `EnergyStation.convertForEnergy(amount,minReturn)`
